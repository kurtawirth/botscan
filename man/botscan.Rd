\usage{
botscan(x, timeout = 30, threshold = 0.43, api = "stream",
  n_tweets = 1000, retweets = FALSE, parse = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A string representing a Twitter search query, in quotation marks.}

\item{timeout}{A number representing the number of seconds the user wishes to
stream tweets on the given search term. This is only applied when using the
default STREAM Twitter API. Default is 30 seconds.}

\item{threshold}{A number between zero and one that determines which botornot 
probability threshold to return. Default is set at 0.43. Only users estimated 
to be more likely than the threshold provided will be regarded as a bot.}

\item{api}{A string specifying which Twitter API to collect data from, the 
\code{"stream"} or \code{"search"} API.  Defaults to \code{"stream"}.}

\item{n_tweets}{A number representing how many tweets to extract.}

\item{retweets}{A logical specifying whether to include retweets in 
the set of tweets to be extracted.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{parse}{A logical specifying whether to automatically parse data into
structured data when querying the streaming API. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, 
making results more usable for most users. Setting to \code{FALSE} will
produce less structured data but allow for faster processing for very large
data projects.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that determines whether to print periodic progress
updates.}
}
\value{
A list of length 3: \itemize{
   \item \code{df}  Dataframe including all data. This includes original data 
   for each tweet as well as BotOMeter scores for each.
   \item \code{prop_user_level_bots}  User-level estimate of proportion of 
   bots among accounts in the searched conversation.
   \item \code{prop_convo_level_bots}  Conversation-level estimate of the 
   proportion of tweets in the searched conversation that are by bots.
}

Scans Twitter Conversations For Bots

\details{
\code{botscan()} takes a Twitter query and produces the proportion of the 
conversation and the users within that conversation that are likely to be bots.

To get a sample of tweets from the stream API, set \code{x = ""}.

The \code{api} argument defaults to \code{"stream"}, using Twitter's 
streaming API and collecting tweets which post after the function is 
called.  The other option, \code{"search"}, uses Twitter's search API, 
collecting tweets which posted before the function was called.
